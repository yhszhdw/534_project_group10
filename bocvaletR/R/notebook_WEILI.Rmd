## Project Overview

This notebook documents my **individual daily contributions** to a financial data and risk analysis project based on **real-world web data**, using the **Bank of Canada Valet API**.

My personal focus in the group project was to:

-   Build a clean and reproducible **data-access pipeline** from a public financial API\
-   Design **reusable R functions** for downloading financial time series\
-   Implement a minimal but interpretable **historical VaR / CVaR risk analysis workflow**\
-   Document development decisions and track progress through GitHub commits

All work reported here corresponds to **my own code contributions**, tracked in my personal GitHub repository.

## Days 1–2 – Project Initialization and API Exploration

**Date:** 2026-01-11 to 2026-01-12

### Work Done

-   Cloned the group GitHub repository and initialized my local R project environment.
-   Studied the Bank of Canada Valet API documentation to understand:
    -   How time series are identified by **series IDs** (e.g., `FXUSDCAD`)
    -   How metadata and observations are separated at the API level
-   Successfully tested direct API access for FX time series data.

### Key Development Decision

I decided **not to rely on metadata-heavy workflows** for my own analysis.\
Instead, I focused on directly validating and using **known, official series IDs** for data retrieval.

This decision:

-   Keeps the data pipeline simple and robust
-   Avoids unnecessary dependencies on group-level metadata logic
-   Makes the downstream risk analysis easily reproducible

### Evidence

-   Initial project setup and API exploration commit:\
    <https://github.com/yhszhdw/534_project_group10/commit/54ed3e01fad31513041fcf2bb7f06885198627eb>

## Days 3–4 – API Wrapper Development and FX Data Validation

**Date:** 2026-01-13 to 2026-01-14

### Work Done

-   Implemented a reusable R function `boc_series()` to:
    -   Query the Bank of Canada API
    -   Download historical observations for a given series ID
    -   Return clean, tidy tibbles suitable for analysis
-   Verified that the daily USD/CAD exchange rate (`FXUSDCAD`) is:
    -   A **daily FX series**
    -   Suitable for financial return and risk analysis
-   Explicitly avoided integrating group-level logic written by teammates, as it was not part of my individual contribution.

### Key Development Decision

I chose to **keep `boc_series()` narrowly scoped**:

-   It only downloads time series observations
-   It assumes the series ID has already been validated
-   It does not mix metadata discovery with numerical data retrieval

This design aligns with good API-wrapping practices and keeps analytical code clean.

### Evidence

-   Commit introducing and refining `boc_series()` for FX data:\
    <https://github.com/yhszhdw/534_project_group10/commit/5b0602aaf794d8e76f26f83583ae5dde5d612152>

## Days 5–6 – FX Returns Construction and Risk Analysis

**Date:** 2026-01-15 to 2026-01-16

### Work Done

-   Retrieved real USD/CAD exchange rate data using:df \<- boc_series("FXUSDCAD")

-   Constructed **daily log returns** from exchange rate levels.

-   Implemented **historical Value-at-Risk (VaR)** and **Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)**.

-   Designed a clean and interpretable FX risk visualization aligned with **DATA 550** principles.

## Key Development Decision

Instead of shading the entire left-tail density, I used explicit **VaR** and **CVaR** reference lines together with **tail rug plots**.\
This choice avoids visual ambiguity, prevents scale misinterpretation, and improves financial interpretability.

## Evidence

-   Commit adding FX risk analysis and visualization workflow:\
    <https://github.com/yhszhdw/534_project_group10/commit/060bd1d56c0c80fff88ba0e3cec56f64cfc9c4d1>

## Summary

This notebook documents my individual contribution to building a **reproducible FX risk analysis pipeline** using real financial web data.

My work emphasizes:

-   Clean API-based data access\
-   Transparent transformation from prices to returns\
-   Interpretable risk metrics and visualization\
-   Clear documentation of development decisions
